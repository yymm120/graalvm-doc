Get started with GraalVM – is a high-performance JDK designed to accelerate Java application performance while consuming fewer resources. GraalVM offers two ways to run Java applications: on the HotSpot JVM with Graal just-in-time (JIT) compiler or as an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled native executable. Besides Java, it provides runtimes for JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and a number of other popular languages. GraalVM’s polyglot capabilities make it possible to mix programming languages in a single application while eliminating any foreign language call costs.

Here you will find information about installing GraalVM Community Edition, running basic applications with it, and adding support for accompanying features. Further, you will learn about the polyglot capabilities of GraalVM and see how to build platform-specific native executables of Java applications.

If you are new to GraalVM, we recommend starting with [Introduction to GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/docs/introduction/), where you will find information about GraalVM’s architecture, distributions available, supported platforms, core and additional features, and much more.

If you have GraalVM already installed and have experience using it, you can skip this getting started guide and proceed to the in-depth [Reference Manuals](https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/reference-manual/).
